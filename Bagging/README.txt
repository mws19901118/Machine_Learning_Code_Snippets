To compile and run my program correctly, please put the bagging source code file(bagging.py), perceptron code ffile(perceptron.py), training data set(e.g. train.dat) and test data set(e.g. test.dat) in the same directory.

There must be a method named "learning" in perceptron.py which implement the learning process of perceptron. The method should take 3 parameters which are training data matrix, learning rate and iteration number in order and return the weight vector of perceptron.

Type "python bagging.py train.dat test.dat numberofbootstrapreplicates learningrate numberofiteration" on the command line. The form of data file should be strictly as same as that of the data file downloaded from the course homepage. It prints the accuracy of test data set.

The program is developed using Python 2.7 and based on Ubuntu 14.04.
